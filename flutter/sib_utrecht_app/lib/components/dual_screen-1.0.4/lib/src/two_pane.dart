/// A widget that positions two panes side by side on uninterrupted screens or
/// on either side of a separating [DisplayFeature] on screens interrupted by a
/// separating [DisplayFeature].
///
/// A [DisplayFeature] separates the screen into sub-screens when both these
/// conditions are met:
///
///   * it obstructs the screen, meaning the area it occupies is not 0. Display
///     features of type [DisplayFeatureType.fold] can have height 0 or width 0
///     and not be obstructing the screen.
///   * it is at least as tall as the screen, producing a left and right
///     sub-screen or it is at least as wide as the screen, producing a top and
///     bottom sub-screen.
///
/// When positioning the two panes, [direction], [paneProportion] and
/// [panePriority] parameters are ignored and values are replaced in order to
/// avoid the separating [DisplayFeature]:
///
///   * On screens with a separating [DisplayFeature], the two panes are
///     positioned on each side of the feature. If the [DisplayFeature] splits
///     the screen left and right, [direction] is [Axis.horizontal]. Otherwise,
///     [direction] is [Axis.vertical]. The [paneProportion] and [panePriority]
///     parameters are also ignored and each pane occupies a sub-screen.
///   * On screens without a separating [DisplayFeature], [direction] is used
///     for deciding if the 2 panes are laid out horizontally or vertically and
///     [paneProportion] is used for deciding how much space each pane takes.
///
/// This widget is similar to [Flex] and also takes [textDirection] and
/// [verticalDirection] parameters, which are used for deciding in what order
/// the panes are laid out (e.g [TextDirection.ltr] would position [startPane]
/// on the left and [endPane] on the right).
///
/// The [panePriority] parameter can be used to display only one pane on screens
/// without any separating [DisplayFeature], by using [TwoPanePriority.start]
/// or [TwoPanePriority.end]. When [TwoPanePriority.both] is used or when the
/// screen has a separating [DisplayFeature], both panes are visible.
///
/// Similarly to [SafeArea] and [DisplayFeatureSubScreen], this widget assumes
/// there is no distance between it and the first [MediaQuery] ancestor. If this
/// is not true, the bounds of display features will not align with the
/// separation between the two panes. The [padding] parameter can be used to align
/// TwoPane with the real position of display features. The [padding] parameter is
/// the padding between TwoPane and the edges of the screen.
///
/// Pane widgets are wrapped in modified [MediaQuery] parents, removing padding,
/// insets and display features that no longer intersect with them.
///
/// If not provided, [textDirection] defaults to the ambient [Directionality].
/// If none are provided, then the widget asserts during build in debug mode.
/// The resolved [direction] of TwoPane is [Axis.horizontal] when there are
/// display features separating the screen into two horizontal sub-screens, in
/// which case the provided [direction] is ignored.
///
/// See also
///
///  * [DisplayFeature] and [MediaQueryData.displayFeatures], to further
///    understand display features
///  * [MediaQueryData.removeDisplayFeatures] which is used to remove padding,
///    insets and display features for each pane.
